## Why Trencher Bundler?

Trencher Bundler isn't just another token launcher. We built the most complete bundling solution for Pump.fun that handles everything from launch to profit-taking.

**What sets us apart:**

- **Rapid Wallet Market Making** - Once your token launches, the system automatically creates and manages wallets for post-launch market making. Set it and forget it.

- **Intelligent Auto-Buying & Selling** - Configure automatic buying and selling based on external SOL volume. The system monitors market activity and executes trades when conditions are met, taking profits at the right moments.

- **Smart Profit Taking** - Built-in profit-taking logic analyzes external trader volume to determine optimal exit points. Stop guessing when to sell.

- **Wallet Mixing & Privacy** - Advanced wallet mixing with intermediary hops for enhanced privacy. All private keys are automatically saved to `archive.txt` during cross-chain mixing and intermediary wallet operations, so you never lose access to your funds even if something fails mid-process.

- **Cross-Chain Bubble Maps** - Integrated support for cross-chain swaps via bubble maps, letting you move liquidity across chains seamlessly.

Whether you're launching your first token or managing multiple launches, Trencher Bundler provides the tools and automation you need.

## How It Works

### The Bundler System

Trencher Bundler uses **Jito bundles** to coordinate multiple transactions in a single block:

1. **Token Creation** - Creates your token on Pump.fun
2. **DEV Buy** - First buy from your creator wallet (right after creation)
3. **Bundle Buys** - Multiple wallets buying simultaneously in the same block
4. **Jito Execution** - All transactions bundled and sent via Jito block engine

**Why Jito?**
- **Atomic Execution** - All buys land in the same block or none do
- **MEV Protection** - Harder for bots to front-run your launch
- **Speed** - Faster than sending transactions individually

### Lookup Tables (LUTs)

The bundler automatically creates and uses **Address Lookup Tables (LUTs)** to:
- Reduce transaction size (allows more wallets per bundle)
- Lower transaction fees
- Enable larger bundles (up to 20+ wallets)

LUTs are created automatically and extended as needed. You can view them on Solana Explorer.

## File Structure & Key Management

**All wallet keys are saved locally in the `keys/` directory:**

```
keys/
├── current-run.json          # Current launch data (wallets, mint, status)
├── data.json                 # All created wallets (bundle, DEV, holder)
├── warmed-wallets.json       # Pre-warmed wallets for reuse
├── archive.txt               # ALL private keys backup (critical for recovery)
├── intermediary-wallets.json # Privacy routing wallets (if enabled)
├── mixing-wallets.json       # Mixing wallets (if privacy mode enabled)
├── pnl/                      # Profit & loss tracking files
│   ├── pnl-*.json           # Per-token P&L data
│   └── profit-loss.json     # Aggregate P&L tracking
├── token-configs/           # Saved token configurations
└── wallet-profiles/         # Saved wallet profiles
```

**Critical Security Notes:**
- The `keys/` folder is **gitignored** by default
- All keys are stored **locally only** - never sent anywhere
- Keys are saved **immediately** after wallet creation
- **ALL private keys are automatically saved to `archive.txt`** - This includes:
  - Bundle wallet keys
  - Holder wallet keys
  - DEV wallet keys
  - **Intermediary wallet keys** (during privacy routing)
  - **Mixing wallet keys** (during cross-chain operations)
- **If anything fails during cross-chain mixing or intermediary wallet operations, your keys are safely stored in `archive.txt`**
- **Backup your `keys/` folder regularly!**
- **Never commit or share your `.env` file or `keys/` folder**

### How Wallets Are Saved

**During Launch:**
1. Wallets are created and **immediately saved** to `data.json`
2. **All private keys are automatically appended to `archive.txt`** for safety
3. Current run data is saved to `current-run.json` (includes all wallet addresses)
4. If launch fails, wallets are still saved - **your SOL is recoverable**

**During Privacy Operations:**
- When using intermediary wallets or mixing wallets, **all private keys are saved to `archive.txt`** before any cross-chain or mixing operations begin
- This ensures you can recover funds even if the process fails mid-operation

**Wallet Types:**
- **DEV Wallet** - Creator wallet that makes the first buy
- **Bundle Wallets** - Wallets that buy in the Jito bundle
- **Holder Wallets** - Wallets for post-launch trading
- **Intermediary Wallets** - Privacy routing wallets (if enabled)

## Usage Guide

### Launching a Token

1. **Configure Settings** - Go to Settings tab, set your RPC and funding wallet
2. **Prepare Wallets** - Go to Wallets tab:
   - Create fresh wallets, OR
   - Warm existing wallets, OR
   - Use a mix of both
3. **Configure Launch** - Go to Launch Token tab:
   - Set token name, symbol, image
   - Configure DEV buy amount
   - Select bundle wallets and amounts
   - Configure holder wallets (post-launch trading)
4. **Launch** - Click "Launch Token" and watch the progress
5. **Monitor** - Switch to Trading Terminal to see live trades and P&L

### Auto-Sell Configuration

Configure automatic selling per wallet:
- **Threshold** - Price threshold to trigger sell
- **Percentage** - What % of tokens to sell
- **MEV Protection** - Delay selling to avoid front-running

### Rapid Sell

Instantly sell all positions via Jito bundle:
```bash
npm run rapid-sell
```

Or use the "Sell All" button in the Trading Terminal.

## Button Reference Guide

### Launch Token Page

## Configuration Options

See `.env.example` for all available options. Key settings:

```env
# Bundle Configuration
BUNDLE_WALLET_COUNT=3              # Number of bundle wallets
BUNDLE_SWAP_AMOUNTS=1,0.5,0.25     # SOL amounts per wallet

# Jito Settings
JITO_FEE=0.001                     # Jito tip (SOL)
MINIMUM_JITO_TIP=0.0001            # Minimum tip

# Auto Actions
AUTO_RAPID_SELL=false              # Auto rapid sell after launch
AUTO_GATHER=true                   # Auto gather SOL after rapid sell
WEBSOCKET_TRACKING_ENABLED=true    # Real-time trade tracking
```

## Recovering Stuck Funds

If a launch fails or you need to recover SOL from wallets:

### Option 1: Gather from Current Run (Recommended)
```bash
npm run gather
```
Recovers SOL from wallets in the most recent launch (`current-run.json`).

### Option 2: Gather from All Wallets
```bash
npm run gather-all
```
Recovers SOL from **all** wallets in `data.json` (all launches).

### Option 3: Withdraw from Specific Wallet Types
```bash
# Withdraw from mixing/intermediary wallets only
npm run withdraw-mixers

# Withdraw from all wallets (including DEV, Bundle, Holder)
npm run withdraw-all
```

### Option 4: Recovery Center (Interactive)
```bash
npm run recovery
```
Interactive menu to recover from specific wallet types.

**What Gets Recovered:**
- Native SOL (withdrawable balance)
- Token account rent (when closing empty token accounts)
- Leaves rent-exempt balance (can't withdraw to zero)

**Note:** The gather scripts automatically:
- Check wallet balances
- Close empty token accounts
- Transfer SOL back to your main funding wallet
- Show detailed recovery summary

## Troubleshooting

### Launch Fails / Bundle Doesn't Land

**Possible causes:**
- **Rate limits** - Use a dedicated RPC (Helius/QuickNode)
- **Low Jito tip** - Increase `JITO_FEE` in `.env` (try 0.01 SOL)
- **Insufficient funds** - Check wallet balances
- **Network congestion** - Wait and retry

**Solution:** Use the "Retry" button in the Recovery section to resend the bundle.

### Missing Trades in P&L

If some bundle buys aren't showing:
- Check PumpPortal WebSocket connection (should auto-reconnect)
- Manual injection ensures all buys are tracked
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors

### Can't Recover Funds

**If `npm run gather` fails:**
1. Check `keys/current-run.json` exists
2. Verify your main wallet has SOL for transaction fees
3. Try `npm run gather-all` to recover from all wallets
4. Use `npm run recovery` for interactive recovery

### White Screen / Frontend Not Loading

1. Check API server is running (`node control-panel-server.js`)
2. Check frontend dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify ports 3001 (API) and 5173 (frontend) are available

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit sensitive files:**
   - `.env` (contains private keys)
   - `keys/` folder (contains all wallet keys)
   - These are gitignored by default

2. **Backup your keys:**
   - Regularly backup the `keys/` folder
   - Store backups in a secure location (encrypted drive, password manager)

3. **Use dedicated RPC:**
   - Public RPCs have rate limits
   - Use Helius/QuickNode free tier (works great)

4. **Test with small amounts first:**
   - Start with 0.1 SOL test launches
   - Verify everything works before larger launches
